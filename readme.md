# VanillaPi.com

VanillaPi is a project in the making. The aim is to deveolp a Open-Source blog highlighting some of the most popular open source projects and new up-and-coming projects.

This blog will assist with getting started in open source development. It will cover tools and techniques to get started and how to make contributions.

My desire is to cover a new Open-Source project each week and give an indepth lesson on how to navigate through, and understand the structure and techniques involved in that particular project.

I will cover the setup and layout of the project, the technologies needed to develop and the history of the project.

### Why?

As a developer, at first I found it quite difficult to navigate through and understand source code. I felt out of my depth, and didn't know where to start. 
Thankfully I pushed myself to become more familiar with analysing Source-Code (Still a work in progress) and now I find it immensly beneficial to read through and tear apart code. There are a lot of lessons that can be learned from viewing the development methods of others and even spotting changes that you would like to make.

As of now my contributions to Open-Source projects is low, but throughout this journey I hope to further develop my skills, and put them to use. While simultaneously documenting and sharing my experiences.

As of now the site is not active and is temporarily hosted on GitHub. 

As the project develops I will move hosting over to a Raspberry-Pi cluster.
